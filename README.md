# ROGUE - The Game DataBase

This is a `Fully Responsive` web application which was inspired by the RAWG web app, which happens to be the world's largest video game database.

`Meticulously created using the official RAWG Web Api`, this app provides all the major features like  dynamically rendering the games, filtered results, infinite scrolling etc. 

The app is programmed using `React and Typescript` and `Vercel` was used as a deployment solution, thereby adhering to the industry standard.
